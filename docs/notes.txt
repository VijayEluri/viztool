viztool notes -*- mode: outline -*-

* Driver enhancements
Create a driver that loads parameters from a properties file. That file
can specify what visualization to use, parameters for that visualization
and overall parameters like packages to exclude, etc.

Add support for regular expressions in the package inclusion and exclusion
specifications.

Move the package exclusion processing into the PackageEnumerator rather
than the current hack of having the HierarchyVisualizer do it.

** From <jon@latchkey.com>:
Create an Ant Task that allows you to do something like this:

<target name="viztool">
  <viztool properties="viztool.properties">
    <classpath>
    </classpath>
  </viztool>
</target>

Or:

<target name="viztool">
  <viztool exclude="" include="">
    <classpath>
    </classpath>
  </viztool>
</target>

That would be fun.

* Chain visualization enhancements
Lay chains out vertically rather than horizontally to achieve better
density and a more aesthetic arrangement. This will probably require a
searching algorithm to try to determine how tall to make each column to
make best use of space.

Provide the option to arrange packages in the order that allows them to
fit most compactly on the page rather than visualizing them in
alphabetical order and pushing a package to a new page when it doesn't fit
in the remaining space on the current page.

Provide an option to split packages up to fit them in the remaining space
on a page rather than pushing them to the next page.

* Summary visualization enhancements
Format field/method names in bold

* General visualization enhancements
Add page numbers somewhere. [shaper@waywardgeeks.org]

* Printing enhancements
Add current date to printed page.

* Architecture
Create renderable primitives and build the visualizations from those
primitives rather than encapsulating things in Layout/RenderUtil.
