    The layout and rendering code that performs the actual visualization.

    <p> Presently, the only visuzliation is provided by the {@link
      com.samskivert.viztool.viz.HierarchyVisualizer} and it is accessed
      directly by the driver. This will likely eventually change and an
      interface will be provided through which the driver accesses
      visualizers (probably {@link com.samskivert.viztool.viz.Visualizer})
      and generates visualizations.

    <p> The hierarchy visualizer makes use of some lower level
      visualization components that will likely come in handy in
      generating other visualizations. These include the {@link
      com.samskivert.viztool.viz.Element} and {@link
      com.samskivert.viztool.viz.ElementLayout} interfaces.

    <p> The {@link com.samskivert.viztool.viz.ChainGroup} class should
      probably evolve into something more general that lays out
      collections of elements that are all part of a particular package
      rather than explicitly working with {@link
      com.samskivert.viztool.viz.Chain} instances.
